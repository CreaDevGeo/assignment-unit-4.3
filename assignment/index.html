    <ul>
      <li>How do I use the isFull function in the addItems to prevent more than max items from being added to the basket?
        I tried to do this but the code I was entering wouldn't work properly, so I resorted to writing a different code 
        that works the same but doesn't use the isFull function. What could the solution basket?
